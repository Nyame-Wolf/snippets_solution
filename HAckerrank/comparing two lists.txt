Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale
from  1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet a =(a[0],a[1],a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge to be 
the triplet b=(b[0],b[1],b[2]).

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with =b[0] ,a[1] with= b[1] and a[2]with b[2]) .

If a[i]>b[i] then Alice is awarded  point.
If a[i]<b[i], then Bob is awarded  point.
Ifa[i]=b[i] , then neither person receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given  a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

For example, a=[1,2,3] and b=[3,2,1]. For elements 0, Bob is awarded a point because a[0]<b[i0] . For the equal elements  
a[1]and b[1] , no points are earned. 
Finally, for elements 2, a[2]>b[2] so Alice receives a point. Your return array would [1,1] be with Alice's score first 
and Bob's second.
