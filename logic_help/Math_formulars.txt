for slope:
(y2- y1) / (x2 - x1)
to get the y intercept: y = mx + b
m = slope
replace values of x and y with any two points (either x1 and y1) or (x2 and y2)

to convert from farenheit to celcious and vice versa:
f = 9/5c + 32
c = 5/9(f- 32)

DIVISIBILITY TESTS
Divisibility tests are rules that let you quickly tell if one number is divisible
by another. There are many divisibility tests. Here are some of the most useful 
and easy to remember:

 
A number is divisible by 2 if the last (ones) digit is divisible by 2. That is, 
the last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. (We then say the number is an even number.)
For example, in the number 236, the last digit is 6. Since 6 is divisible by 2 
(6 ÷ 2 = 3), 236 is divisible by 2.
 

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of all the digits is divisible by 3.
For example, the sum of the digits of 411 is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. Since 6 is divisible
by 3 (), 411 is divisible by 3.

A number is divisible by 5 if the last digit is 0 or 5. For example, 275 and 1,340
 are divisible by 5 because the last digits are 5 and 0.
 

A number is divisible by 10 if the last digit is 0. For example, 520 is divisible
by 10 (last digit is 0).
 

Other useful divisibility tests:

 

4: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.

 

6: A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

 

9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.


Triangular/Triangle numbers: counts objects arranged in an equilateral triangle. 
The nth triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with
n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. 
The sequence of triangular numbers (sequence A000217 in the OEIS), starting at the
0th triangular number, is

0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190,
210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 
666...

producing a rectangle with dimensions (n*(n+1))which is also the number of objects
in the rectangle. Clearly, the triangular number itself is always exactly half of
the number of objects in such a figure, or: Tn = (n(n+1))/2

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Tetrahedral number, or triangular pyramidal number, is a figurate number that
represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides, called a tetrahedron.
The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.
The first ten tetrahedral numbers are:
1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, … (sequence A000292 in the OEIS)
The formula for the n-th tetrahedral number is represented by the 3rd rising 
factorial of n divided by the factorial of 3:

Tn = (n(n+1)(n+2))/6
 
pentatope number is a number in the fifth cell of any row of Pascal's triangle 
starting with the 5-term row 1 4 6 4 1 either from left to right or from right to
left.The first few numbers of this kind are :
1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 126, 210, 330, 495, 715, 1001, 1365 (sequence A000332 in the OEIS)
A pentatope with side length 5 contains 70 3-spheres. Each layer represents one of
the first five tetrahedral numbers. For example the bottom (green) layer has 35 
spheres in total.
Pentatope numbers belong in the class of figurate numbers, which can be represented
as regular, discrete geometric patterns.
The formula for the nth pentatopic number is:

Tn = (n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3))/24

simplex numbers: A single point may be considered a 0-simplex, and a line segment
may be considered a 1-simplex. A simplex may be defined as the smallest convex set
containing the given vertices. A regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular
polytope.
